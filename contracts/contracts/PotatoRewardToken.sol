/// @title PotatoRewardToken
/// @notice A {PotatoToken} whose holders earn the trading fees their token
///         generates. Hold 1% of the circulating supply and you earn ~1% of the
///         holder-fee share of every swap that happens while you hold it — in
///         ETH, continuously, with no window and no waiting.
///
///         Everything {PotatoToken} guarantees still holds: fixed supply, no
///         owner, no mint, no pause, no blacklist, plus the time-boxed anti-snipe
///         cap. This adds exactly one thing — a fee-accrual accumulator.
///
///         ## Accounting is decoupled from custody
///
///         Swap fees physically sit inside the locked Uniswap position until
///         somebody calls `PotatoFeeLocker.collect`. The naive reading is that
///         holders therefore cannot be credited until a collect happens — which
///         would mean fees are attributed to whoever holds AFTER the harvest,
///         not to whoever held while the volume was actually traded. Someone
///         could hold through a week of trading, sell an hour before a collect,
///         and receive nothing.
///
///         But Uniswap tracks fee growth CONTINUOUSLY: `feeGrowthInside` moves on
///         every swap and is readable at any instant. So this contract does not
///         wait for custody. On every transfer it reads what the position has
///         earned to date and credits the delta immediately. A `collect` is then
///         nothing more than a funding operation — it moves money that holders
///         were already credited for, and {claim} triggers one itself when the
///         contract is short.
///
///         Two consequences worth understanding:
///
///         - **Attribution is exact.** You earn for the swaps that happen while
///           you hold, second by second, whether or not anyone ever cranks a
///           harvest. Selling stops accrual; it never forfeits what you earned.
///         - **There is nothing left to snipe.** An earlier design streamed each
///           harvest over 24h specifically so nobody could buy in one block
///           before a collect and take a cut of a whole week's fees. With no
///           lump-sum distribution event, that attack has no target: buying just
///           before a collect credits you nothing, because a collect no longer
///           decides who gets paid.
///
///         ## Why pull, not push
///
///         Paying every holder inside `_transfer` is unbounded gas: you cannot
///         loop the holder set. Tokens that advertise "auto-payouts" actually run
///         a gas-budgeted queue — every trade costs hundreds of thousands of extra
///         gas, payouts go in queue order rather than fairly, and the tail stops
///         getting paid once the holder count outgrows the budget.
///
///         Instead this uses the standard per-share accumulator: {rewardPerShareX128}
///         only ever grows, and each account's {rewardDebtX128} records where it
///         stood when that account's balance last changed. The difference times
///         their balance is what they earned. That is O(1) per transfer regardless
///         of holder count — no loops, no queue, no upper bound on holders.
///
///         ## Who counts as a holder
///
///         {eligibleSupply} is the circulating supply: total minus the locked LP
///         (custodied by the {PoolManager}), the pad, the locker, and the burn
///         address. Your share is always measured against that, so the ~entire
///         supply parked in the locked position never dilutes real holders. It is
///         maintained incrementally on transfer — never by iterating holders.
///
///         ## What changed for Uniswap V4
///
///         V3 exposed fee growth on a per-pair pool contract (`feeGrowthGlobal` +
///         `ticks`). V4 keeps the identical accounting inside the singleton and
///         exposes it through `StateLibrary.getFeeGrowthInside(manager, poolId,
///         lower, upper)`, which returns fee growth for the exact range in one
///         call. So {_feeGrowthInsideWeth} is now a single library read against
///         the manager keyed by {poolId}; every downstream formula is unchanged.
