/// @notice A launchpad that skips bonding curves entirely. Every launch mints a
///         fixed 1B supply straight into a permanently locked, single-sided
///         Uniswap V3 position:
///
///         1. `createToken` deploys a fixed-supply ERC-20 (entire supply held here).
///         2. It creates + initializes the token/WETH 1% pool at the START price
///            (≈ 3 ETH FDV), positioned exactly on a tick boundary.
///         3. It mints the ENTIRE supply as SINGLE-SIDED liquidity (token only,
///            ZERO WETH) across [tickLower, tickUpper] (top ≈ 530 ETH FDV). The LP
///            NFT is minted straight into the {PotatoFeeLocker} — locked forever,
///            principal unruggable, but swap fees remain collectable (50/50
///            creator/treasury) "for life".
///         4. If ETH is attached, an atomic dev-buy swaps WETH->token on the fresh
///            pool and delivers the tokens to the creator. There is no separate
///            curve fee — the dev-buy pays the pool's normal 1% LP fee, which
///            accrues to the locked position (creator + treasury via the locker).
///
///         As buyers trade WETH->token, price walks up through the range from the
///         open (≈3 ETH FDV) toward the top (≈530 ETH FDV); the launch supply is
///         sold single-sided out of the locked LP. Correct for BOTH token/WETH
