///
///         What CAN be taken out is swap fees: anyone may call {collect}, which
///         harvests accrued trading fees. The WETH side is split 50/50 between the
///         token's creator (or a redirect beneficiary — see {redirectFees}) and the
///         protocol treasury; the launched-token side is burned (sent to a dead
///         address), so token fees are deflationary.
///
///         Fee delivery is asymmetric on purpose:
///         - The TREASURY's share is auto-forwarded (pushed) on every {collect}.
///           Since {collect} is permissionless, any cranker — or a swap that
///           triggers it — pays the treasury automatically, no manual claim.
///           The push uses a low-level call that can NEVER revert {collect}: if
///           the treasury can't receive, its share falls back to a claimable
///           balance, so fee collection (and trading) can never be bricked.
///         - The CREATOR's share stays pull-based ({claim}); creators are active
///           participants, and pull-payment avoids dusting them / keeps {collect}
